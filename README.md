# Exploring_Wine_Quality_EDA_ML

## Overview

Welcome to the **Exploring_Wine_Quality_EDA_ML** repository, where we embark on a fascinating journey into the world of wine quality analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML). This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for uncovering insights, predicting quality, and understanding the nuances that define exceptional wines.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that walk through the process of EDA and ML analysis on wine quality datasets.
- `models/`: Here, you'll find Machine Learning models that predict and classify wine quality based on various attributes.
- `visualizations/`: A showcase of captivating visualizations that bring to life the intricate characteristics of wines and their impact on overall quality.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruturaj0626/Exploring_Wine_Quality_EDA_ML.git
   ```

2. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to uncover hidden insights within wine quality data.

3. Experiment with the ML models in the `models/` directory to predict and classify wine quality.

4. Immerse yourself in the captivating visualizations within the `visualizations/` directory to visually grasp the nuances of wine attributes.
